# Alembic Migrations

This project includes Alembic for managing database migrations.

## Usage

1. **Install Alembic** (if not already):
   ```bash
   poetry add alembic --dev
   ```

2. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Create a new migration:**
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe changes"
   ```

## Files
- `alembic.ini` — Alembic configuration
- `alembic/` — Migration environment and versions

## Notes
- The Alembic environment is pre-configured to use the generated `database.py` and `Base`.
- Make sure your models are imported in `database.py` for autogeneration to detect schema changes.
